  abstract = {In this paper, an efficient semi-implicit difference scheme for solving the fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with wave operator are proposed and analyzed. The semi-implicit scheme involves three-time levels, is unconditionally stable and fourth-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time. Furthermore, the unique solvability, unconditional stability and convergence of the method in the L{$\infty$}-norm are proved rigorously by the energy method. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to confirm our theoretical results.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the construction and analysis of the energy-conserving numerical schemes for the generalized nonlinear space fractional Schr\"odinger equations with wave operator. Combining the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, we present an energy-conserving and linearly implicit scheme, while the previous conservative schemes are generally fully implicit. The energy-conserving property, boundedness and convergence of the numerical solution of the fully discrete scheme are derived for one and multi-dimensional cases. The numerical analysis is also considered. Finally, numerical examples on several fractional models illustrate that the proposed scheme can guarantee conservation of the system energy and confirm our theoretical results.},
